### light Stack Virtual Machine in C for scripting on embedded systems

(c) Dmitry Ponyatov <<dponyatov@gmail.com>> , public domain software

Weâ€™ll see how to implement very **simple stack VM** able to be used
as **script host engine** for very small embedded systems,<br>
build say on Cortex-M microcontrollers with a few Kb of RAM.
You can use it if you can admit slower execution but<br>
more stable and secure code and want some cool things like 
multitasking, clustering and supervising for a low price
(primarily **good for user scripting**).
